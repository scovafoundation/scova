        He made me realise that to be one with Him, and to teach other people to

        like they truly belong. There exists in them, a sort of mental divide on

        Here's the thing though – in such a beaurocratic system, not everyone

        Arguably, not every person in the position that I was, is able to
        coherently conjure up actual words to describe these motions. The point
        that I'm really trying to make here – is that we are all just, almost
        always, inadequate. We have to work to perfect ourselves to become our
        best selves. A 22 year old cannot be the best version of a human –
        that's a recipe for disaster. You peak too soon, so you spend the rest
        of your life looking back at the supposed "best" times of your life. The
        best, should always be what's to come – not what's already gone; because
        what kind of an existence would that be? Isn't the system of wiping your
        memories at each birth, but keeping your intuition, fair?

        can fathom – because I was just pondering over it today. I was thinking
        about why the collective consistently arrives at a place where the
        decadence of the individual causes a catastrophic collapse of the entire
        system. If it is so easy, almost natural to act like there are no rules
        in the Game of Life, and that you can get away with anything as long as
        nobody living being knows about it, how has the world functioned well
        enough such that we have managed to persist thus far?
