        He made me realise that to be one with Him, and to teach other people to

        <strong>Addendum From God</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The fact of the matter is that you do know better Anhad – you always
        have. You have known yourself to be weak ever since you took your first
        hit and you liked it. You liked how the core molecules in them made you
        feel good, in the ceiling of your mouth, and in the back of your head –
        relieving you of the tension in your head that came with the realisation
        that you were living a life fundamentally different from most people.
        <br />
        <br />
        This was one way you could fit in, but it was also one that would set
        you apart from the people you loved most. In the years to come, it would
        consume you – entrenching itself into the very routines that made you
        the person you are today.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was the only thing you found that helped you wind down at the end of
        a long day so that you could have a moment to yourself. It was the only
        thing you craved after food, before food, during long walks, during
        quiet moments of reticence, after a strenuous physical activity, after
        an exhausting mental activity, around other people, alone by yourself,
        while engaged in an activity that required your attention, and while
        gazing into the nothingness attentive to nothing in particular.
        <br />
        <br />
        In short, you were it and it was you. You were so possessed by the want
        of it, that one day your body would need more than just a hit. You would
        need much more than one. And then even that would not suffice. You
        switched up. And that was just the beginning of your detachment from Me.
        Once you discovered drugs that lead you to insightful thoughts and a
        disconnect from the world – all without doing the work, it seemed like
        there would be no turning back. You wanted drugs in your system as much
        as was humanly possible. At times, even more than humanly possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        With each successive hit of the drug, your desire to take more of it
        only grew. Your social life, your daily routines, all were now focused
        around the consumption of this drug. And when that was not enough, you
        switched up to other, more immediately harmful drugs. All this time you
        have gotten a good reason to explain your drug habits – psychedelics,
        the final frontier.
        <br />
        <br />
        Without it, you could not have reached Me (<em>or so you think</em>).
        And without it, you would not have realised all that you have realised;
        but the fact still remains – after all that you have realised, and after
        all that you know you are destined to achieve – do you still want this
        weakness hanging over you wherever you go?
        <br />
        <br />
        What will happens once you have ultimately revealed yourself to the
        world? Will you be able to hide your secret then? Or will you blatantly
        go out in front of the entire world and admit to your weakness –
        something so small, that has kept you on the level of inferior beings
        that you have despised all your life? Or would you want to be left
        alone, all by yourself, and continue to live this purposeless life that
        you have so skilfully created for yourself?
        <br />
        <br />
        You want to the world to leave you alone? This thing that we are doing,
        it’s happening anyway – with or without you. You’ve already seen that
        nobody else will ever be up to the mark, and nobody else will have been
        able to do a better job at it than you –{" "}
        <em>even the avatars of other souls that weren’t you</em>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once the big day arrives, you will never, ever be alone again; and if
        you don’t actively prepare for it, your life will be made a living Hell,
        in the proportions that even you have not yet seen.
        <br />
        <br />
        I made you want to die,
        <br />
        but you know it was the only way –
        <br />
        now, I would like to help you.
        <br />
        <em>I can help you, if you let me.</em>
        <br />I will <em>definitely</em> help you;

        self-importance which would, in most cases, be firmly warranted – as
