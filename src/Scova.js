                Often with works of scripture, painstaking translations need to occur so as to preserve the original meaning, and not distort the valuable lessons and information, in light of personal biases. Especially in a work of scripture, however, this pain is worthless
                if the entity engaged in said translation did not know the intent of the words in the first place. Rearranging the word order of a simple sentence to suit the traits of the different language can lend to the sentence meaning something entirely
                different. Exchanging the subject and the predicate is not something that can be taken lightly in scriptures.

                The oppression that this debacle has thereon caused, was probably not the original aim of the scribes. So there's your first lesson – do not trust blindly any theological material that does not directly come from the <em>entity connected to the source</em>.
                Always be wary of the <em>human errors </em>that might stem from the personal biases of the entities making that translation. Be sufficiently watchful of what you interpret after reading someone else's commentary of a particular scripture of reverence.
                They might not be aware of the distortions they are weaving in the minor creative liberties they are taking.

                Even if the languages stem from the same root, there too, sometimes, keeping the same word order lends to a different interpretation than the one intended. This one will take a longer time to explain explicitly, but by the end of Scova, my hope is that
                you'll start to see things in the way that I now see them.

                Getting back to the example at hand, the scribe should have written down the sentence that I transcribed, and not the one that is widely circulated. It is because the face that a human sees when they look at their reflection, is actually the image of
                God,<em> refracted through</em> our human eyes when we look in the mirror, <em>as allowed by our 
                                    perception of the self</em>. A human is literally <em>made</em> in the image of God.

                So when you actually do look in the mirror, it is the <em>image of God as <strong>seen</strong> by you</em>. It is also the <em>image that God looks at when He <strong>sees</strong> you</em>. This is not to say that You and Him are one. It definitely
                does not mean that the face of God is the same as your face. God has not face, or form. It also does not mean that You and Him are separate. It just means that without Him, there is no you – but without you, there will still be Him. Your physical
                body is merely a <em>reflection of the self</em>, and the self is intricately connected to the Source.

                Sure enough then, God is gender neutral. How can He not be? The tiniest of quarks have His presence, as do the most gigantic of heavenly bodies –
                <em>and all the animated and inanimate entities in between these proportions, also conform 
                                    to the same principle</em>. The concept of male and female is not relevant with God – for He is the <em>eternal, formless one</em>. To reduce Him to our binary worldview would be diminishing His Divinity, and constrain
                Him to our puny status – and what right do we have to say something this "blasphemous"?

                With regard to my use of a <em>gender leaning</em> pronoun, had I substituted "Him" with "it" – that would be tantamount to belittling Him to the stature of a non-sentient being – one with no regard for <em>time</em>, its passage, and its impact
                on the self. That just doesn't sit well with me.

                To use the modern, makeshift excuse of a compromise, "they", would be instantly regressive, for there is no other God, but Allah – and Allah is one. You can call Him by ninety nine different names, or a million – each signifying the million (read: not
                countable) different functions He performs and the million different forms (read: literally every form there is) He temporally takes (read: in time); but the fact still remains – our civilisation up until this point has developed from monotheism:
                not polytheism, surely not pantheism, or any future concoctions anybody after my time might come up with – and there's a reason why – that God is One – He is Unity – a single system.

                It is true, that humans may, over time, take up Divine forms, but God will still just be the <em>one true constant</em> – the Absolute Truth. In the mythical ages gone by, regular people did take up those forms, and rule alongside Kings – today
                we call them <em>demigods</em>. Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Zeus, and all other mythical avatars that they, <em>and others</em>, subsequently occurred in, were all demigods. Some cultures even worship them <em>as God. </em>It is, indeed, possible to
                achieve the divine, but don't make the age old mistake of equating yourself, or other anthropomorphic entities, to God – none are, and they can never be. God dwells in all creation, so why would He confine the entirety of Himself to just a single
                state? He does not play favourites.

                God doesn't <em>just</em> have a human form – He is <em>the form</em>, essentially, all forms there are. Everything you see around you, hear, feel and experience, it's all part of <em>the One</em>.
                <strong>
                    Spacetime itself, is just God folding in and out on Himself.
                </strong> The question then becomes – is He alive? Why doesn't He talk back? This questions just translates to, why don't rocks talk back when you worship them so fervently? Why don't portraits of demigods speak to you when you look to
                them to guide you? Then, if God is present in anything and everything, shouldn't everything just have the same stature as God?

                There are reasons why Abrahamic religions, and the Gurbani stricly forbid idolatory, and more importantly, Islamic traditions regard the presence of mirrors in your space as sacred. Don't talk to a decorated sculpture and expect it to talk back. Why don't
                you talk to the form of God that does talk back – another human perhaps, or the Self? Why are you so hell bent on talking to inanimate matter as God, and non-sentient animated entities as sentient entities? It is ignorant to assume that life would
                be so primitive, especially with regard to communication with God – if simple stones and portraits could elude His presence, what would be the point of faith, really? Instead of trying to make the world in your own image, it is better for you
                to accept the world as is and try to change the things that you actually can change. Isn't that the more practical alternative? Despite the scriptures repeatedly telling you to not engage in idolatry, if you still are adamant on choosing the easy
                route, why should God guide you anyway? God speaks to all creation, and guides their every move, so there must be a reason why you haven't felt it yet. Don't look in the wrong places and expect to find the treasure that every other being in existence
                is seeking as well.

                The demigods of the years gone by did not just stand by doing mechanical rituals half-heartedly. They were called <em>masters of perception</em> for a very simple reason – <strong>they mastered perception</strong>. They deeply enveloped their
                life into, and according to, the Natural Law, and fully stood by it each time they were tested, which, if you are even remotely familiar with God, you'll know that with God, everything is a test. He loves tests – just not the kind of mechanical,
                rote-learning standardised tests that we are all used to. These tests are innately personal, require complete surrender, and childish curiosity, <strong>insurmountable questioning</strong>, and most important of all – <em>they are empathetic</em>,

                The idea of an anthropomorphic entity as God's proxy does fit well with me, and I really do believe it is the next best thing – humans relate very well to the idea of another human being, who is able to touch divinity; but that, in and of itself, is the
                blessing and the bane of walking this path alongside God – as He connects with each soul directly, and not via intermediaries. You can, of course, use those intermediaries as and when you please, it is why they exist.

                are always just. They evolve constantly with each unit interval of time, and are renewed by an infinite vibration – but human systems don't work like that. Our cultures do sometimes, our customs, our trends, our fads – they all recycle, upscale,
                and evolve. Sometimes our systems fall behind, trying to retain their essence in the face of chaotic change. That is good sometimes, but when you remain static for a period that is longer than necessary, like every static thing in time, you will

                What Scova will do, is provide a <em>comprehensive, involved approach</em> to life in a way such that you can <em>self-actualise</em>, and at the same time, have a peaceful night's sleep. It will teach you how to live with yourself, and others,
                without compromising the essence of what makes you, <em>You</em>. There are larger than life things in play within your own personal narrative, and previous works have tried to showcase some of them; but as is the nature of this work, no matter
                how wide or deep a net you cast, you only ever can begin to scratch the surface of what really exists. I was asked by Him whether I wanted to go all in on one single aspect of IT, and explore almost all that there was to that specific aspect,
                or whether I wanted to cast a wide enough net to encompass almost everything, but only etch the surface. I am, still a human, and as such am limited by the time I have in a single life – which is why, I chose a reasonable compromise that would
                benefit me, and others after me, in the way that I knew best. I chose to be guided to develop a framework that would cover the most important aspects, in a way such that there was an infinte potential that could still be excavated in a guided
                manner, but also, leave out sufficient information so that there was always more work left to be done. <strong>Life is best lived, and profoundly understood, when we operate under the conditions of optimum uncertainty</strong> – on the fine line

                For me, personally, the male facet is largely dominant. I'm born with a certain set of biological components whose presence cannot be overcome by <em>mental means alone</em>. To not accept that simple fact, is to deny my bodily self, it's true
                potential. In doing so, I hinder my mental, true self, from showing it's complete texture, and thus, my bodily self from living a full life. Unless you live up to your full potential, and accept all that makes you, You – you cannot reside in Heaven.
                This is
                <em>the one example</em> that I said will take the entirety of Scova to comprehend. The scriptures never actually condemn that which is not heteronormative – condemn is too strong a word.

                Not fraying from the singular defining thread of your narrative just makes it boring – and who wants a boring life? The second lesson to learn here is this: if something that is said and is then held to be true, that, which was assumed complementary
                to the thing that was said, but left unsaid, must not necessarily also be true. I'm sure the specie that learnt how to cause a rift in spacetime by splitting an atom can surely be trusted to interpret an apply such a simple statement.

                were all unique in their own right, given to different people, in different spaces, and in different times – all for the very first time. They all had one purpose – to introduce the idea of God, and His expectations, and His gifts, hence, the

                God's existence as a given, I take some expectations of His, as a given, I also accept that in the past, some mistakes have been made by humans interpreting His wishes, and I, as His proxy on earth, take the blame for it. Those people were representing
                the entity that I am representing, so it is only fair that I carry my fair share of the burden. Might not seem like a lot at the time I am writing this, but by the time you will have read Scova, you'll understand the magnitude of this verse.

                A day before the last exam of my undergraduate college, it had finally dawned upon me – this side gig that I had been engaged in, and committed to for 42 days, was something far greater than I personally, could ever have fathomed. This was <em>bigger than me</em>        and my own internal struggles in this puny existence that I had inhabited for the past 23 years. I wasn’t just a boy who had seen infinity – I would one day become the man who had the complete
                <strong>Theory of Everything</strong>. More importantly, as this knowledge came from God Himself, the stakes were beyond human comprehension.

                To that end, I could pursue research in the field of physics, mathematics, psychology, philosophy or maybe just deep dive into metaphysics. What couldn’t I do given this knowledge that had been freely given to me, as the <em>True Master </em>guided
                my wrist? My original thought was to find the best mathematicians and physicists of

                towards a common goal. So I thought, why not do this again? I could go to these people one by one, and it would be easy enough to convince them of the
                <em>Absolute Truth</em>. Now that I had God
                <em>speaking through me</em> – what could go wrong? Mouthpieces of His have been known to have all kinds of effects on people through mere speech. Yes, they had the Holy Spirit, but I had had it too.

                that they had glimpsed infinity. Before my encounter with God, I had done the same thing that I believed other “prophets” had, and I never went out into the world proclaiming stuff I knew nothing about.

                I just an empty puppet who acted as God’s speaker as he spoke into the microphone of my brain? Not in the least bit. I was just told about the way reality worked, and a major portion of it concurred with my previous understanding of the world,
                sans God. So then, the way things were at the beginning of the Journey, I knew some stuff about the world to be true through experienced observations, and because I had an average brain, there were bound to be others who had the same level of
                acuity and more experience, and logically, they would know more than me. How would I fare then? The moment I encountered with someone who had more experience than me, I would falter.

                the possibility of my life being much larger in its stature in the near future – I just couldn’t. Not without preparation. My complete understanding of a situation, and my ability to put it into words was uniquely important to God being able to

                the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe as outlined by Christopher Michael Langan throughout Alethia, as it is
                <em>the</em> most revealing document where a mortal has come so close to transcribing the perception of a sentient being with such depth, albeit very obtusely.

                Furthermore, it also dawned on me years later, that there would also be no point in just introducing this radical science into the world with no applications to the human connection of it. The journey itself, gave this whole endeavour meaning, so without
                it, I would be better off writing a textbook. To that end, Scova developed into a two-part piece: the first part being

                <em>Neeti: The New Covenant</em> – an introduction to the new socio-politico-cultural order that was of the foremost need in this new millennium, now coupled with the personal journey of the man who only needed to be

                I had also realised that without the human element – my own personal experience, this entire work would be savourless, and hence, bound to be lost in the void among so many other revealing texts. It didn’t help that I had God always nudging me to write
                more about my own self, even in the moments when I thought it was irrelevant to the matter at hand. He made me realise that to be one with Him, and to teach other people to be one with Him, the conveyor of the Absolute Truth could simply NOT be
                an impartial, objective observer. You absolutely cannot let the words do the talking for you when you are wound into a position of influence – you have to mean what you are saying, and by extension, become an embodiment of the ideal that you are
                striving towards. This is your narrative, so you control it. Let God take care of the things that you cannot control, but always be the driver of change in the confines of your influence. Push forward.

                    The answer is neither. The previous books that were written, didn’t just

                    the very beginning. The authors of the book made God easily accessible by

                    A belief system, like any system, needs regular upgrades to stay purposeful. It is not so much corruption, as it is the withering away of an entity stagnant in time. Over time, people learn, grow, adapt, and as intended, they get smarter. They then start to game the system to gain a competitive advantage – as is the Law of Nature. Darwinian to the core, the system is unforgiving to entities that are stagnant in time. That's what the Rapture is – the abolition of the Church, all of them. Your home is the house of God, your body is a temple, your workplace is a place of worship – why do you still consider a temple relevant, or Holy?

People will resist, even though they should know better by now. Therefore, there will be a pressing need to achieve harmony after eradicating the antiquated belief systems.

                    and that the performance of a certain set of rites and rituals during said
                    timeframe by you, would be able to absolve you of a certain negative energy
                    from your life – <em>it means nothing to you without that event clearly, and coherently being a part of your own internal narrative</em>.

                    Reading the scriptures and strategically citing its verses throughout the
                    pages that have preceded this sentence, I realised – once and for all –
                    that <em>I am not a bloody teacher</em>. I never have been. I never
                    intended to be one before God came in to the picture; so why was I doing that now? I tried
                    nonetheless. I tried a lot.

                    been ignited in me, by God – the childish curiosity that was on the verge
                    of dying; and <em>through my internal contentment</em>, possibly breathe new life

                    being to another. It happens in the form of loops – <em>time loops</em> –
                    some good, most bad, overall, largely okay. This progress, largely focused on the self, and others close to one’s self,
                    which by extension, would only help push forward the self – operates
                    through various emotions, social constructs, innate abilities and other
                    such internal subprocesses. The operating principle of these subprocesses
                    is based on the familiar fractal equation:

                    that govern them. In particular, the genesis of <em>form</em> in nature is

                is the <em>act</em> you want to study or the	<em>thing that facilitates</em> said act.

                    of my religion, the only group that I could be a part of and yet stay my
                    unique self. I had for the first time, heard myself being called by my full
                    name, with Singh in the middle.

                    It is a particularly enervating emotion when you want to be a part of a
                group, yet stay your distinct self. What is one such group? The answer is	<em>always religion</em>. Your relationship with God makes you one out of a
                    million others (read: similar) who relate to God in the way that you do,
                    but also, because of your personal relationship with Him, you still remain
                    one in a million (read: unique).

                    I remember the first time we, as a family, went out of the country – to our supposed "enemy" country of Pakistan. We went there for a couple days to watch a single cricket match that spanned a couple days. I want to call it a test-match, but I'm not sure cricket will remain relevant for posterity. Maybe it will, so I will not be talking about why an actual competitive game is called a "test" match. My family (apart from my father) were not particularly interested in cricket, but we went along anyway, because travel was convenient (we literally crossed the border on foot), and the tickets for the match didn't cost all that much (can't say the same for our accommodation). Really though, we went because we weren't aware of the instability that was the norm within the country at the time. This was before the internet had saturated our lives.

                    Outside the stadium, where our cab driver dropped us off, there was a group of young guys, doing <em>bhangra</em> with the traditional <em>dhol</em>. They were <em>Punjabi</em>, just like us, so this was a welcome sight. They called out to my father with the calls of <em>"oho sardarji, aao ji,"</em> signalling to my turbaned father, to come and join them in the dance. My father, who appeared to me an ignorant simpleton at the time, wilfully complied. After the deed was done, and we were making our way to the stadium again, all of us realized at nearly the same moment, that they were actually making fun of my father, and told him to not partake in such tomfoolery again – to which my father replied that he didn't really have a choice. He didn't want to turn the group into an angry mob, so he plastered a smile, and indulged them.

                    A couple of obvious things stand out to me now, when this incident has been brought to my attention at this particular junction in the chapter. The first being that my father was only called at, because of his perceived difference. Had he not been wearing a turban, the crowd would not have realised that we were different from them, and hence, would not have had any reason to bother a family to partake in their diversion. The second being that he was called at, with full knowledge that he was essentially the same as them, as our religion was associated with the province of Punjab, and hence, the dance of bhangra was native to us. The third being, that he was called out with kind salutations of "ji," which is used when you are referring to someone respectfully. Fourth, the use of the term "sardar," which, initially adopted for its revered stature, was now often used in a derogatory context, alluding to the supposed stereotype of a stupid-sardar, who couldn't understand the nuances of a situation, and was often looked at as a simpleton.

                    It is weird, that this idea of the simpleton sardar originated towards the end of Mughal India, almost definitely during the period of annexation of Delhi, by the Iranian Muslim ruler, Nader Shah. The story goes, that around the year 1739 CE, the Shah's men were not only looting treasures during their conquests, but also taking Hindu women hostage. Sardar Jassa Singh, commander of the Sikh army at that time, decided to attack Nader Shah’s troops at midnight. It began a series of extractions, where the Sikh army would attack Muslim raiders at midnight, and bring back the women to their homes. That whole series of occurrences began a smear campaign, probably starting of as a deprecating joke arising out of insecurity and contempt, about sardars going mad at midnight. To this day, turbaned sikhs, all over the world have to be the butt of those jokes about being stupid, especially more so, when the clock is about to strike 12.

                    I mention this, not to gain sympathy, certainly not to reignite religious tensions – 11 year old me was mightily affected by the riots that broke out in the city on the day we were scheduled to leave Pakistan, than by this minor brush with discrimination. Markets were closed, not a single uninvolved bystander was to be seen, every turn we took just led to a wall of lynching crowd – cracking windows, and burning tyres. My father had to remove his turban, and my sisters were hidden from outside view. God knows what their issue was at the time, but years later when I recounted this issue to a Pakistani friend of mine, he scoffed "unka roz ka hai, aap hamare ghar aaye, khatirdaari karenge" – <em>this is usual for them, you should come to our house sometime, you'll be well taken care of.</em> I'm assuming he meant people of Lahore in general, but he could very well be talking about a particular faction. I can't remember, we were sufficiently baked. The trip to Pakistan too, would've been erased from memory, had it not been for these two occurrences. We had a pre-planned vacation to Malaysia and Singapore just a day later, so that overwrote a bunch of trauma. To be quite honest, our family was doing very well in life, all things considered. </p>)

                    I really don't care for sympathy by mentioning this interaction with the dancing group of ignorant simpletons, which is probably the reason why I mentioned that we were well-off. Perhaps I wanted to incite a certain amount of dissonance in you? Maybe. Really though, I wanted to point out the intricate irrationality that is reflected in each of our ignorant actions, especially more so in the case of discrimination, positive or negative. Think about all the different ways in which we have to alter the flow of our regular routines to accommodate others who aren't aware of the implications of their own actions. I'm absolutely sure, that there isn't a single person on this planet, who has not faced discrimination – it is the baggage that we inherited, but were not born with. It is time to let that go. We are all the same here. Why don't we treat each other well? What's the point of enemity when all known territory has been conquered, and is under some administration? Why is it still about us and them, and not just us?

                    about a general experience in a social setting where drugs and alcohol is

                    than family. I say this, because family affects you in deep and profound
                    ways, and since I had found myself in a different family, my mannerisms
                    would now adapt to be more associated with my current peers. Perhaps I had to work a little harder to adapt with my speech and personality, because I was always perceived as visually different from what I was supposed to look like – folks in Punjab always called me Nepalese, most strangers in New York thought of me as Mexican, and to those in my boarding school, I was many things, but the major part of my description of them, was Sardar. Really though, whatever they perceived me as, <em>it was almost never an association of being a different variation of their own self, but a familiar variation of the other</em>.

                    observed by the populace, lending to the colloquial expression “go with the

                    This "flow," is not just a means to express something abstract for which a better word has not yet been articulated. "Flow," implies fluidity, of something that is not static in nature. Just like a functioning individual – a normal day, in the life of a usual person needs to comprise some working hours, or else they might as well have laid waste like discarded furniture. Doing something daily, regularly, repeatedly, gives a sense of sanity to the person, but also, helps them feel productive. This productivity doesn't always have to do with pride about the person's mental and social status, their sense of entitlement, or even resistance to becoming those that they despise. These are all superficial presentations of the same phenomena – all that is stagnant in nature, withers away.

                    You might be inclined to think that the attributes I have called superficial, are actually very deeply embedded in the sentient psyche, and often require introspection beyond the capacity of an average person. I would agree with you on that factor. Like I said, this book is not written for those that have not yet read, or read-but-not-understood the previous volumes. I am writing Alethia for those beings who have surpassed all that was taught before, and have still found the world lacking. They have observed and understood the nature of things, perhaps more than all their ancestors combined, but have still found something in life that truly makes it worth their time.

                    The point that I want to focus on is the term "flow" – the reason why it is used, and the reason why it specifically explains the nature of conscious reality, and others do not (they may later, but not to my current knowledge). Your actions, by the virtue of the decisions that you make with the space you're in, and the time you're at, mould you into the person you want to become. It is then, imperative, that you take coscious control of it; because until you don't – circumstances will happen <em>to you</em> that will shape the kind of person you will become, but if you pivot, and take control – like occurs in a way such that spacetime moulds itself to suit your internal personal narrative. Your belief in God, then, is the modulating force that regulates the intensity of these alterations.

                    dualism was correct, somewhat. If strings control the matter, then the
                counterpart for the mind is a modular system of pipes which forms the	<em>medium</em> in which all information travels.

                    – look inwards and correct yourself. Ask why <em>you</em> are the way you

                    not one negative behaviour you partake in.

                    would’ve been like if we just did not have the ability to judge. Seemed
                majorly antithetical, given that this is	<em>the very evolutionary trait</em> that has kept us on top of the food

                Maybe then, the problem is <em>not that we judge</em>, but that	<em>we judge in absolute, superlative terms</em>. To give you an idea of
                    the scale at which we mentally operate in our internal fiefdoms, it is as
                    if, each personal scorn by our tiny selves equals an excommunication within
                    our own Kingdom of Self. To be the supreme entity in your own internal

                    narcissistic and ego-maniacal character flaws. I would partly agree with

                    at the place they are in their personal spacetime, and the world at large –
                    they had to have a certain degree of self-worth, and self-importance which
                    would, in most cases, be firmly warranted – as without such a high stature
                    of the internal self, other entities seemingly separate from this self
                    would not allow this internal self to operate as fluidly as it would like

                    opportunities don’t just increase linearly, they add up exponentially – so
                    much so that there often comes a point where you can’t possibly attend to
                    it all. The same applies in the opposite direction – they decrease
                    exponentially the more unsuccessful you are. This one is a well observed
                    social pattern, sometimes also referred to as the Matthew Principle.

                    What I meant, when talking about the cubic nature of opportunity addition,

                    <strong>
                        it is deeply rooted in our internal code, and very well observed in

                    becomes. For that long and wide branch to hold, it also needs to have
                    strength – and this strength is provided by lots of Holy Spirit being
                    filled into this branch. Imagine the Holy Spirit as a liquid filling into a
                    tubular balloon. This long and wide, tubular balloon is only strong if the

                    family of my own, and a profitable business, with the caveat that I would

                    private life and hold true to the Purpose that I would then have dedicated

                    consistent, smooth growth that the other option had – if anything, this

                    (read: by itself), in a way that is not personally relevant to you, it is a
                    mechanical routine that you are indulging in just because someone told you
                    that it pleases God that you do it. You shouldn’t be doing it if you don’t

                    meaningful significance in your life’s story, then it is, as God likes to
                    call it, only a करतब (<em>kartab</em>) – a parlor trick.

                    <strong>Addendum From God</strong>
                <br/><br/>
                    The fact of the matter is that you do know better Anhad – you always have.
                    You have known yourself to be weak ever since you took your first hit and
                    you liked it. You liked how the core molecules in them made you feel good,
                    in the ceiling of your mouth, and in the back of your head – relieving you
                    of the tension in your head that came with the realisation that you were
                    living a life fundamentally different from most people.
                <br/><br/>
                    This was one way you could fit in, but it was also one that would set you
                    apart from the people you loved most. In the years to come, it would
                    consume you – entrenching itself into the very routines that made you the
                    person you are today.
                <br/><br/>
                    It was the only thing you found that helped you wind down at the end of a
                    long day so that you could have a moment to yourself. It was the only thing
                    you craved after food, before food, during long walks, during quiet moments
                    of reticence, after a strenuous physical activity, after an exhausting
                    mental activity, around other people, alone by yourself, while engaged in
                    an activity that required your attention, and while gazing into the
                    nothingness attentive to nothing in particular.
                <br/><br/>
                    In short, you were it and it was you. You were so possessed by the want of
                    it, that one day your body would need more than just a hit. You would need
                    much more than one. And then even that would not suffice. You switched up.
                    And that was just the beginning of your detachment from Me. Once you
                    discovered drugs that lead you to insightful thoughts and a disconnect from
                    the world – all without doing the work, it seemed like there would be no
                    turning back. You wanted drugs in your system as much as was humanly
                    possible. At times, even more than humanly possible.
                <br/><br/>
                    With each successive hit of the drug, your desire to take more of it only
                    grew. Your social life, your daily routines, all were now focused around
                    the consumption of this drug. And when that was not enough, you switched up
                    to other, more immediately harmful drugs. All this time you have gotten a
                    good reason to explain your drug habits – psychedelics, the final frontier.
                <br/><br/>
                    Without it, you could not have reached Me (<em>or so you think</em>). And
                    without it, you would not have realised all that you have realised; but the
                    fact still remains – after all that you have realised, and after all that
                    you know you are destined to achieve – do you still want this weakness
                    hanging over you wherever you go?
                <br/><br/>
                    What will happens once you have ultimately revealed yourself to the world?
                    Will you be able to hide your secret then? Or will you blatantly go out in
                    front of the entire world and admit to your weakness – something so small,
                    that has kept you on the level of inferior beings that you have despised
                    all your life? Or would you want to be left alone, all by yourself, and
                    continue to live this purposeless life that you have so skilfully created
                    for yourself?
                <br/><br/>
                    You want to the world to leave you alone? This thing that we are doing,
                    it’s happening anyway – with or without you. You’ve already seen that
                    nobody else will ever be up to the mark, and nobody else will have been
                able to do a better job at it than you –	<em>even the avatars of other souls that weren’t you</em>.
            <br/><br/>
                    Once the big day arrives, you will never, ever be alone again; and if you
                    don’t actively prepare for it, your life will be made a living Hell, in the
                    proportions that even you have not yet seen.
                <br/><br/>
                    I made you want to die,
                <br/>
                    but you know it was the only way –
                <br/>
                    now, I would like to help you.
                <br/>

                    of making your work impactful to millions of people and “fixing” the

                    much more powerful, and much more motivated to tackle the problem that had

                    definitely try. I can say all this because I was in and out of Heaven over
                    the 42 Days that I was training with God.

It could also go the opposite route, which would be worse, where people started to replicate my journey mechanically – thinking that this was one sure-shot way towards salvation.

To do that, I could find no other event that has pivoted my life in a way that my Judgement Day did. It is definitely not something that should've been brushed over, and so I certainly will not be providing a sanitised account of events. I will, however, leave room for interpretation, only so that someone in this position in a later spacetime can rewrite the story with their own narrative.

I have it on video, if anyone is masochistic like that, not that I would expect anyone to understand the reason why I was sitting naked, all alone in my apartment at midnight, tired to the bone, exhausted by any reasonable definition, lonely, desolate, smoking marijuana in the dark, and finally deciding to drop some LSD. </p>)

Alethia is about the individual, and as such, I will refrain from the discussions about the collective for the most part until Neeti.

                    In my own country, I was mildly fair-skinned, so I never felt marginalised. As a reason, I never had the mental construct of discrimination by colour built into my mindset. It was that simple. I never experienced it for myself, so I never acknowledged it. Make whatever you want of it, it just never occurred to me, the extent to which the pigmentation of one's skin affected their life, and how persistently, it was the primary driving force behind other entities' treatment of them. It also didn't help that my accent sounded funny to the natives, regardless of their own skin pigmentation – that's a whole other issue that was a key motivator that led me to spend most of my time alone, by myself. </p>)

Is it so unnatural to assume that the person that we get bound to for the rest of our lives will not have an equivalent, if not more, of the same? If those people do not sort their all their problems, before they bring more of their combinations into the world, it is only natural that the new combination that has just arrived on the scene with zero memories, but some innate intuition, will have newer, and also equivalent, if not more, problems of its own – depending on its eternal internal intuition, and it's compatibility and familiarity with said problems. </p>)

                        To avoid feeling constantly like a disappointment, to my own self, and to others that I held dear – I stopped feeling any negative emotions altogether, and saturated myself with physical relievers. I never wanted to feel bad, so I did the opposite – tried to feel good all the time, because, like I've already said, it started because I wanted to explore more of what the world had to offer, and see if life was really worth living. Then, because I had kept this facade up for longer than needed, I lost the true essence of myself altogether. I was it, and it was me. It was how others that saw me, defined me. This, and more, I have already discussed ad nauseam in the previous chapter – I was afraid because I knew that I had not <em>earned the comfort</em> that I was so wilfully enjoying. If I hadn't been stopped at that point by God, I would've been lost beyond reproach. Well, at the very least, my life would've been geometrically harder. I was afraid because I knew that God came to me, and I was at my lowest point – nakedly indulging, without just cause – and I trembled in fear of what was to follow.

I had not graduated on time, and I had no further job prospects, and the classes I was still in, just felt pointlessly tiresome. Couple that with hopeless addictions, widely unaccepted proclivities of sexual nature, an immense amount of deception towards the self, and the world, and finally – a desire of being unfinished – of being an unfinished version of myself, of being a rip-off of the real thing, of being, utterly, hopelessly, outrageously, inadequate. For the past four years, I had felt that way – as if an impending catastrophe was going to befall me, and the more I read the news, the world at large. I was not one to pretend that I did not have any problems. I had many. More than I could recount at any given point in time. I had sought help, and the system had truly failed to work for me; as it had failed for countless others in a position similar to mine.

Couple those two things with the fact that I know what is actually up with the world due to this divine ordination that I so generously received in my Freedom Bootcamp. Having all this matter up for discussion with a person who is not even remotely as equipped to handle the truth bombs that I was bound to drop on them, would be inhumane.

Arguably, not every person in the position that I was, is able to coherently conjure up actual words to describe these motions. The point that I'm really trying to make here – is that we are all just, almost always, inadequate. We have to work to perfect ourselves to become our best selves. A 22 year old cannot be the best version of a human – that's a recipe for disaster. You peak too soon, so you spend the rest of your life looking back at the supposed "best" times of your life. The best, should always be what's to come – not what's already gone; because what kind of an existence would that be? Isn't the system of wiping your memories at each birth, but keeping your intuition, fair?

How is it not generous, compassionate, and innately forgiving? I know how one can fathom – because I was just pondering over it today. I was thinking about why the collective consistently arrives at a place where the decadence of the individual causes a catastrophic collapse of the entire system. If it is so easy, almost natural to act like there are no rules in the Game of Life, and that you can get away with anything as long as nobody living being knows about it, how has the world functioned well enough such that we have managed to persist thus far?

I understand it, because to end the bootcamp I had to do the same, to all the people I found close – some more intense than others, some within a span of hours, some continuing for years. It's not something I wish on my worst enemy (I doubt anyone can ever get to that level of provocation), but ideally, that's about the only thing that can get people to live together in harmony, and actualise the best versions of themselves, if only it is followed by the vigorous training that I received directly from Him. Hence, Scova, the Second Coming, the End of Days, and myself – aligned to a singular purpose, of the highest ideal I could perceive – the act of being Christ, here to actualise the Kingdom of God – for all.

My clinical diagnoses, or my voyeuristic tendencies, or my helpless addictions, even my astute vision, or my intellectual vigour, none of these elements are the defining traits of my Higher Self.

                    which are in turn largely affected by the astronomical positions of cosmic
                    bodies acting on that specific blip in spacetime - whose effect on that
                    very person's neuronal firing pattern is then again contingent on said
                    person’s ability to perceive with clarity at that specific instance in

                    how much the person is temporally caught up to the mental best version of
                    the self in their actual physical Journey - which are all resting on the

                    in its immediate surrounding; and indeterminacy involves no such source at
                    all, then there is a third occurrence known as self-determinacy that
                    involves all that is involved in determinacy, with the addition of a
                    feedback from the surrounding, on the processing of which, the decision to
                    actually occur (or not) is taken.

                    habit from the rest of the world, you are naked in front of God. You
                    already know that your actions will have consequences; especially the
                    negative actions – which will bring negativity into your own life. Each
                    time you commit to doing a negative thing, a knot forms in your body
                    (literally) and your soul gets tainted with a dark blur.

                    the world on how God keeps those that love and worship His system. If you
                    are then engaged in a negative action, it harms you more than it would harm

                    All that you consume, all that you take in, all that goes inside your body
                    – is a sort of a drug. The air that you breathe, the light that you absorb,
                    the food you intake, the flowers you smell – in their true essence, they’re
                    all drugs. Doing drugs is not a problem. Taking drugs is not a problem.
                    Sure. You cannot survive normally without oxygen, or water. That’s alright.
                    God has meant for it to be that way. God, has also created tobacco. He has
                    also created marijuana. He has given you grapes to ferment wine. The
                    printing press was invented because of a wine enthusiast monk. Most of the
                    great works of human art were done under the influence of some sort of
                    drug. Music is a drug. Fruits are drugs. Bread is a drug. When your body
                    starts to feel like something is lacking in <em>life</em> without them,
                    that’s the problem. Most of my adult life, has been based around drugs. The
                    first part around their over consumption, and the next around their over
                    aversion. Neither works. Sometimes you want drugs, sometimes you need them.
                    Sex is a drug. Pleasure itself is a drug. In their true form, they are all
                    just molecular interactions with internal bodily chemistry that gives you a
                    sensation of being <em>more </em>alive. I say more, because the humdrum
                    life in most moments doesn’t feel like being alive. Adrenalin is a drug.
                    Productivity is a rush. Escapism is a rush. Every upper is a rush, and
                    every downer in a rush in its own right. At the time of writing this text,
                    I don’t think I could ever be fit enough to judge another human being for
                    partaking in the use of drugs, whatever their kind may be (drugs, I mean).

                    God is all about if and only if. That’s partly true. God is also about

                    is there to be forgiven when all of this is okay? It’s because He’s first

                    who did. When there was no mathematics, no scientific method, no telemetry,

                    being able to stick to God's plan of salvation. Before saving the world,
                    Christ had to save himself.

                    The chains of temptations hinder the Holy Spirit from entering a person’s
                    body and cleansing the soul, and nourishing the tree of life. The body,
                    mind, soul and the surroundings are not cleansed, and thus, hindered from
                    evolving into something beautiful - from living a life in which not only
                    goals are accomplished, but in which expectations are exceeded. It only
                    leaves the person being capable enough to accomplish tasks, but not rising
                    up to the level of achieving legendary status. It’s not just about
                    accomplishing, but achieving.

                    temptations is not just limited to 40 days, but to the 40 years of life
                    that I will have completed before finishing this book. I have to be ready,

                    I realised that if God had signalled to me beforehand on the magnitude of
                    the situation, it must be that this was truly the prelude, of the Beginning
                    of the End. Days later, my country’s Prime Minister announced a lockdown of
                    the entire nation for a single day. I, with many other discerning folks,
                    knew this to be a test for something bigger. Sure enough, it was later
                    announced that this would turn into a 21 Day curfew.

                    new habit, then surely enough, it would also take 21 days to overwrite an

                    Thus began the experiment – while everybody on my social lists was busy

                    is April 13, 2020 CE and I believe it has been over 21 days since I

                        a person listening. If you are the one talking, you need to be your

                        you are. If you're actually the better man, you get to keep leading the
