        Often with works of scripture, painstaking translations need to occur so as to preserve the original meaning, and not distort the valuable lessons and information, in light of personal biases. Especially in a work of scripture, however, this pain is worthless
        if the entity engaged in said translation did not know the intent of the words in the first place. Rearranging the word order of a simple sentence to suit the traits of the different language can lend to the sentence meaning something entirely
        different. Exchanging the subject and the predicate is not something that can be taken lightly in scriptures.

        The oppression that this debacle has thereon caused, was probably not the original aim of the scribes. So there's your first lesson – do not trust blindly any theological material that does not directly come from the <em>entity connected to the source</em>.
        Always be wary of the <em>human errors </em>that might stem from the personal biases of the entities making that translation. Be sufficiently watchful of what you interpret after reading someone else's commentary of a particular scripture of reverence.
        They might not be aware of the distortions they are weaving in the minor creative liberties they are taking.

        Even if the languages stem from the same root, there too, sometimes, keeping the same word order lends to a different interpretation than the one intended. This one will take a longer time to explain explicitly, but by the end of Scova, my hope is that

        Getting back to the example at hand, the scribe should have written down the sentence that I transcribed, and not the one that is widely circulated. It is because the face that a human sees when they look at their reflection, is actually the image of
        God,
        <em>refracted through</em> our human eyes when we look in the mirror, <em>as allowed by our 
                            perception of the self</em>. A human is literally <em>made</em> in the image of God.

        So when you actually do look in the mirror, it is the <em>image of God as <strong>seen</strong> by you</em>. It is also the <em>image that God looks at when He <strong>sees</strong> you</em>. This is not to say that You and Him are one. It definitely
        does not mean that the face of God is the same as your face. God has not face, or form. It also does not mean that You and Him are separate. It just means that without Him, there is no you – but without you, there will still be Him. Your physical
        body is merely a <em>reflection of the self</em>, and the self is intricately connected to the Source.

        Sure enough then, God is gender neutral. How can He not be? The tiniest of quarks have His presence, as do the most gigantic of heavenly bodies –
        <em>and all the animated and inanimate entities in between these proportions, also conform 
                            to the same principle</em>. The concept of male and female is not relevant with God – for He is the <em>eternal, formless one</em>. To reduce Him to our binary worldview would be diminishing His Divinity, and constrain
        Him to our puny status – and what right do we have to say something this "blasphemous"?

        With regard to my use of a <em>gender leaning</em> pronoun, had I substituted "Him" with "it" – that would be tantamount to belittling Him to the stature of a non-sentient being – one with no regard for <em>time</em>, its passage, and its impact

        To use the modern, makeshift excuse of a compromise, "they", would be instantly regressive, for there is no other God, but Allah – and Allah is one. You can call Him by ninety nine different names, or a million – each signifying the million (read: not
        countable) different functions He performs and the million different forms (read: literally every form there is) He temporally takes (read: in time); but the fact still remains – our civilisation up until this point has developed from monotheism:
        not polytheism, surely not pantheism, or any future concoctions anybody after my time might come up with – and there's a reason why – that God is One – He is Unity – a single system.

        It is true, that humans may, over time, take up Divine forms, but God will still just be the <em>one true constant</em> – the Absolute Truth. In the mythical ages gone by, regular people did take up those forms, and rule alongside Kings – today
        we call them <em>demigods</em>. Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Zeus, and all other mythical avatars that they, <em>and others</em>, subsequently occurred in, were all demigods. Some cultures even worship them <em>as God. </em>It is, indeed, possible to
        achieve the divine, but don't make the age old mistake of equating yourself, or other anthropomorphic entities, to God – none are, and they can never be. God dwells in all creation, so why would He confine the entirety of Himself to just a single

        There are reasons why Abrahamic religions, and the Gurbani stricly forbid idolatory, and more importantly, Islamic traditions regard the presence of mirrors in your space as sacred. Don't talk to a decorated sculpture and expect it to talk back. Why don't
        you talk to the form of God that does talk back – another human perhaps, or the Self? Why are you so hell bent on talking to inanimate matter as God, and non-sentient animated entities as sentient entities? It is ignorant to assume that life would
        be so primitive, especially with regard to communication with God – if simple stones and portraits could elude His presence, what would be the point of faith, really? Instead of trying to make the world in your own image, it is better for you
        to accept the world as is and try to change the things that you actually can change. Isn't that the more practical alternative? Despite the scriptures repeatedly telling you to not engage in idolatry, if you still are adamant on choosing the easy
        route, why should God guide you anyway? God speaks to all creation, and guides their every move, so there must be a reason why you haven't felt it yet. Don't look in the wrong places and expect to find the treasure that every other being in existence

        without compromising the essence of what makes you, <em>You</em>. There are larger than life things in play within your own personal narrative, and previous works have tried to showcase some of them; but as is the nature of this work, no matter
        how wide or deep a net you cast, you only ever can begin to scratch the surface of what really exists. I was asked by Him whether I wanted to go all in on one single aspect of IT, and explore almost all that there was to that specific aspect,
        or whether I wanted to cast a wide enough net to encompass almost everything, but only etch the surface. I am, still a human, and as such am limited by the time I have in a single life – which is why, I chose a reasonable compromise that would
        benefit me, and others after me, in the way that I knew best. I chose to be guided to develop a framework that would cover the most important aspects, in a way such that there was an infinte potential that could still be excavated in a guided
        manner, but also, leave out sufficient information so that there was always more work left to be done. <strong>Life is best lived, and profoundly understood, when we operate under the conditions of optimum uncertainty</strong> – on the fine line

        in our society has not been one of veneration, but of disdain. I'm very much inclined to ask, "What the hell?", but that would be me looking at the past from the widened perspective of the future that has now already occurred. Hindsight is always
        20/20, so be very cautious in blaming the people of the past. They were, after all, not very much smarter than yourself, and they never had the privilege of looking at the world from a single screen.

        very much aware of each other's faults, as well as accomplishments. It's better if we stop pointing fingers, and collectively accept responsibility. No soul on the planet in this spacetime is new, in the sense that we have all spent our fair share
        of time living and interacting on this planet. God only knows what our deeds were in past lives that we are all in such a deeply connected, collective hell. Even though, this is literally almost three millennia old knowledge, still, I will clarify

        and there was much room for error due to the frailties of eye-witness testimony. Now that we have tools that provide little resistance in transcribing thoughts to words, we are in a good place. We could've been in a better place had there been

        What I really should have said, was that I had conceptually reconciled general relativity with quantum mechanics by following the symphony of space, in time. Semantic inaccuracies of a 23 year old aside, should I have written a paper as suggested by one
        of my friends when I put this question up as my Facebook status on August 9, 2017 CE?

        A day before the last exam of my undergraduate college, it had finally dawned upon me – this side gig that I had been engaged in, and committed to for 42 days, was something far greater than I personally, could ever have fathomed. This was <em>bigger than me</em>        and my own internal struggles in this puny existence that I had inhabited for the past 23 years. I wasn’t just a boy who had seen infinity – I would one day become the man who had the complete
        <strong>Theory of Everything</strong>. More importantly, as this knowledge came from God Himself, the stakes were beyond human comprehension.
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (
    <p>
        To that end, I could pursue research in the field of physics, mathematics, psychology, philosophy or maybe just deep dive into metaphysics. What couldn’t I do given this knowledge that had been freely given to me, as the <em>True Master </em>guided
        my wrist? My original thought was to find the best mathematicians and physicists of
        <em>this</em> time and get them to work on this as a team – for all humanity’s sake.
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (

        Scientists from different walks of life had come together before in a time of uncertainty to sketch out a blueprint for quantum mechanics in the 1927 Solvay Conference. To this day, that Conference is the largest gathering of high-IQ geniuses working
        towards a common goal. So I thought, why not do this again? I could go to these people one by one, and it would be easy enough to convince them of the
        <em>Absolute Truth</em>. Now that I had God
        <em>speaking through me</em> – what could go wrong? Mouthpieces of His have been known to have all kinds of effects on people through mere speech. Yes, they had the Holy Spirit, but I had had it too.
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (
    <p>
        Even still, how could I expect other people to take me seriously? How could I expect people to follow and imbibe this sacred knowledge with whose proclamation I was tasked with? How could I inspire people to drop their live’s work and pivot to the unknown
        wilfully?
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (
    <p>
        Turns out, I wasn’t ready to put <em>all this</em> into speakable terms, and any attempts to take on a task before arduous preparation almost always leads to complementary failures. To that end, God told me to go beyond the confine of influence
        of a single entity, and imbibe the full stature of the position that I was honoured with. What?
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (
    <p>
        What did that position mean? What is the Son of God? What does it mean exactly to “Be Christ”? I wasn’t raised Christian, or Jewish, or even Muslim. How was I to have any remote understanding of this title? Would I read? Watch documentaries? Follow saturations
        of His influence in popular culture? I was freely imparted with wisdom during the 42 days that I walked with God, but to
        <em>be Christ</em>? I was told that all the pain and suffering that I had been through until that moment in time, and if I so chose, after that moment was solely because of the burden that I was going to be built to carry properly.
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (
    <p>
        I was honoured, overwhelmed, ecstatic, shaking to the bone, and on my knees – naked and afraid for my own life, and all of a sudden – I was incharge of all this? This shithole of a fiasco that people called life? How was I any better suited, or worthy,
        or even prepared to be a person like that? Before that moment, I hardly believed in His existence (God and Christ), so then, what did I have?
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (
    <p>
        I had spent most of my life up until that point mocking all that God had supposedly stood for in my time. I had always thought of Jesus and other messengers as psychedelic adventures in a cave who spent too much time staring at their hands and thought
        that they had glimpsed infinity. Before my encounter with God, I had done the same thing that I believed other “prophets” had, and I never went out into the world proclaiming stuff I knew nothing about.
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (
    <p>
        So then, why now? Even if I had the Holy Spirit coursing through me, I did not understand it. Moreover, I knew even little about my own self than I knew about the world. Did I qualify for a special status, now that I had a fancy title? Not really. Was
        I just an empty puppet who acted as God’s speaker as he spoke into the microphone of my brain? Not in the least bit. I was just told about the way reality worked, and a major portion of it concurred with my previous understanding of the world,
        sans God. So then, the way things were at the beginning of the Journey, I knew some stuff about the world to be true through experienced observations, and because I had an average brain, there were bound to be others who had the same level of
        acuity and more experience, and logically, they would know more than me. How would I fare then? The moment I encountered with someone who had more experience than me, I would falter.
    </p>) },{ classes:"verse", html : (
    <p>
        As God’s mouthpiece, I did not have that luxury. I was allowed to make personal mistakes, as long as they did not upset the balance of the world, which, given my position at that point, would not seem like much at that time, but having the knowledge of
        the possibility of my life being much larger in its stature in the near future – I just couldn’t. Not without preparation. My complete understanding of a situation, and my ability to put it into words was uniquely important to God being able to
        <em>speak through me</em>. Only once had I understood a situation completely, could God convey the meaning to another person to the depth that I had understood it myself.

        Moreover, the world wouldn’t change as I thought it would in light of such a revealing paper. I knew this, because one such paper had already been out for years, and the person solely responsible for hashing out the nitty-grits hadn’t had much worldly
        success while engaged in this search for the absolute truth and its applications.

        I don’t know the whole story behind this guy, and I don’t think he wants his story told – but it suffices to say that his paper is so complicated, even I couldn’t <em>yet</em> properly comprehend it in a way to fully explain to a layman of
        <em>
                    how our interaction with God plays out in our perception of the
                    universe – local and otherwise

        Knowing this, I realised that there would be no point in posting a paper online that said things in a way only I could understand. The document had to be structured, and explained properly. To that end, I will be citing, paraphrasing, and reinterpreting
        the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe as outlined by Christopher Michael Langan throughout Alethia, as it is
        <em>the</em> most revealing document where a mortal has come so close to transcribing the perception of a sentient being with such depth, albeit very obtusely.

        Furthermore, it also dawned on me years later, that there would also be no point in just introducing this radical science into the world with no applications to the human connection of it. The journey itself, gave this whole endeavour meaning, so without
        it, I would be better off writing a textbook. To that end, Scova developed into a two-part piece: the first part being
        <em>Alethia</em>, the scientific perspective and the personal journey of the curious boy who knew no bounds. The second part of the book being
        <em>Neeti: The New Covenant</em> – an introduction to the new socio-politico-cultural order that was of the foremost need in this new millennium, now coupled with the personal journey of the man who only needed to be
        <em>truly free</em> <em>while maintaining his existence within </em>the confines of the post-modern world.

        I had also realised that without the human element – my own personal experience, this entire work would be savourless, and hence, bound to be lost in the void among so many other revealing texts. It didn’t help that I had God always nudging me to write
        more about my own self, even in the moments when I thought it was irrelevant to the matter at hand. He made me realise that to be one with Him, and to teach other people to be one with Him, the conveyor of the Absolute Truth could simply NOT be
        an impartial, objective observer. You absolutely cannot let the words do the talking for you when you are wound into a position of influence – you have to mean what you are saying, and by extension, become an embodiment of the ideal that you are
        striving towards. This is your narrative, so you control it. Let God take care of the things that you cannot control, but always be the driver of change in the confines of your influence. Push forward.

        It will have taken Me 15 years of trying, failing, pondering, rewriting, and experiencing more of life itself, to become adequate enough to conjure up actual words to properly communicate what I absorbed in essentially 6 weeks. If that predestination
        argument is taking shape in your mind, hold it in for a while, major revelations are on the way. If I have already bored you, what can I do? I am doing all that is humanly possible.
